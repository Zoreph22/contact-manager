<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you are on Windows x64, and don't want to compile, you can [get latest binaries](https://github.com/Akwd22/contact-manager/releases/latest) and skip the next steps.  
Anyways, to get a local copy up and running follow the steps:

### Prerequisites

To setup the project, you will need:
* [Qt 5.0+](https://www.qt.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Akwd22/contact-manager.git
   ```
2. Compile the project, you have two choices:
   - From command-line:
     ```sh
     cd src
     qmake
     make <debug|release>
     ```
     Then, go to `src/out/<debug|release>` and run `ui` executable to run the app, or `test_logic` if you want to run unit tests.
     
   - From Qt Creator: import the project file `src/main.pro` with default settings, and you should be good.
